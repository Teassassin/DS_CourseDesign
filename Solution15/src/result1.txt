Related to the 'use-it-or-lose-it law' is the 'keep-moving principle'
We learned about stagnation from nature
A river that stops moving gets smelly
The same thing happens to people who stop moving, either mentally or physically
Those who play contact sports know that the player who usually gets hurt the most is the one who is standing still
Of course, you'll need some time to catch your breath every so often, but the essential massage is keep moving, extending and learning
Ships last a lot longer when they go to sea than when they stay in the harbor
The same is true for the airplanes
You don't preserve an airplane by keeping it on the ground, you preserve it by keeping it in service
We also get to live a long healthy life by staying in service
Longevity statistics reveal that the average person doesn't last very long after retirement
The more we'll hear is don't retire
If a fellow says 'I'm 94 years old and I worked all my life', we need to realize, that is how he got to be 94, by staying involved
George Bernard Shaw won a Nobel Prize when he was nearly 70
Benjamin Franklin produced some of his best writings at the age of 84, and Pablo Picasso put brush to canvas right through his eighties
Isn't the issue how old we think we are
A bonus with the 'keep-moving principle' is that while we keep moving, we don't have a chance to worry
Hence we avoid the dreaded paralyses by analysis
In 2014, one in sixteen Americans visited the hospital emergency room for home injuries
One of the main causes of these accidents
By one estimate, people daydream through nearly half of their waking hours
Psychologists have recently focused on the tendency to think about something other than the task one is doing
For one experiment, researchers developed an app to analyze the relationship between daydreaming and happiness
They found that the average person's mind wandered most frequently about 65% of the time during personal activities, such as brushing their teeth and combing their hair
Respondents' minds tended to wander more when they felt upset rather than happy
They were more likely to wander toward pleasant topics than unpleasant ones
How do daydreams affect daydreamers
A wandering mind leaves us vulnerable when driving
In one study, researchers interview 955 people involved in traffic accidents, the majority of them reported having daydream just before the accident
Yet other research suggests that daydreaming has benefits
Researches have found that it gives us a chance to think about our goals and it also seems to increase creativity
In one experiment, 145 undergraduates completed four unusual uses tasks, each requiring them to list as many uses as possible for everyday object
After the first pair of tasks was completed, one group of participants was assigned an undemanding activity intended to cause their minds to wander
When all the participants proceeded to the second pair of tasks, the daydreamers performed 40% better than the others
Today our guest is Rosie Melinda who works as a features editor for Fashion magazine
Hi Rosie, you're a features editor at one of the most widely read women's magazines in the UK
What kind of responsibilities does that job entail
We spend our days looking at ideas from journalists, writing copy for the magazine and website and editing
We do random things like asking people in the street questions and testing sports clothing
We also do less tangible things like understanding what our readers want
It's certainly varied and sometimes bizarre
During your working day what kind of work might you typically do
My day mainly incorporates responding to emails, writing and editing stories and coming up with new feature ideas
How does the job of features editor differ from that of fashion editor or other editorial positions
The feature's team deals with articles such as careers, reports, confidence and confessions
Everything except to fashion and beauty
A lot of people believe that working at a magazine is a glamorous job
Is this an accurate representation of what you do
I'd say it's glamorous to an extent, but not in the way it's portrayed in films
We do have our moments such as interviewing celebrities and attending parties which is a huge thrill

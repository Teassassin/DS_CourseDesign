But Smith counters that if you factor in the hidden cost of government corn subsidies, environment degradation, and decreased human health and animal welfare, grass-fed is the more cost-effective model
'The sun provides the lowest cost of production and the cheapest meat,' he says
Another grass-fed booster spurring farmers to convert is EPIC, which makes meat-based protein bars
Founders Taylor Collins and his wife, Katie Forrest, used to be endurance athletes; now they're advocates of grass-fed meat
Soon after launching EPIC's most successful product-the Bison Bacon Cranberry Bar-Collins and Forrest found they'd exhausted their sources for bison raised exclusively on pasture
When they started researching the supply chain, they learned that only 2-3% of all bison is actually grass-fed
The rest is feed-lot confined and fed grain and corn
But after General Mills bought EPIC in 2016, Collins and Forrest suddenly had the resources they needed to expand their supply chain
So the company teamed up with Wisconsin-based rancher Northstar Bison
EPIC fronted the money for the purchase of $2.5 million worth of young bison that will be raised according to its grass-fed protocols, with a guaranteed purchase price
The message to young people who might not otherwise be able to afford to break into the business is, 'You can purchase this $3 million piece of land here, because I'm guaranteeing you today you'll have 1,000 bison on it
We're bringing new blood into the old, conventional farming ecosystem, which is really cool to see,' Collins explains
Schools are not just a microcosm of society; they mediate it too
The best seek to alleviate the external pressures on their pupils while equipping them better to understand and handle the world outside-at once sheltering them and broadening their horizons
This is ambitious in any circumstances, and in a divided and unequal society the two ideals can clash outright
Trips that many adults would consider the adventure of a lifetime-treks in Borneo, a sports tour to Barbados-appear to have become almost routine at some state schools
Parents are being asked for thousands of pounds
Though schools cannot profit from these trips, the companies that arrange them do
Meanwhile, pupils arrive at school hungry because their families can't afford breakfast
The Child Poverty Action Group says nine out of 30 in every classroom fall below the poverty line
The discrepancy is startlingly apparent
Introducing a fundraising requirement for students does not help, as better-off children can tap up richer aunts and neighbours
Probing the rock pools of a local beach or practising French on a language exchange can fire children's passions
boost their skills and open their eyes to life's possibilities
Educational outings help bright but disadvantaged students to get better scores in A-level tests
In this globalised age, there is a good case for international travel, and some parents say they can manage the cost of a school trip abroad more easily than a family holiday
Even in the face of immense and mounting financial pressures, some schools have shown remarkable determination and ingenuity in ensuring that all their pupils are able to take up opportunities that may be truly life-changing
Methods such as whole-school fundraising, with the proceeds pooled, can help to extend opportunities and fuel community spirit
But £3,000 trips cannot be justified when the average income for families with children is just over £30,000
Such initiatives close doors for many pupils
Some parents pull their children out of school because of expensive field trips
Even parents who can see that a trip is little more than a party or celebration may well feel guilt that their child is left behind
The Department for Education's guidance says schools can charge only for board and lodging if the trip is part of the syllabus, and that students receiving government aid are exempt from these costs
However, many schools seem to ignore the advice; and it does not cover the kind of glamorous, exotic trips, which are becoming increasingly common
Schools cannot be expected to bring together communities single-handed
But the least we should expect is that they do not foster divisions and exclude those who are already disadvantaged
Rising temperatures and overfishing in the pristinewaters around the Antarctic could see King penguin populations pushed to the brink of extinction by the end of the century, according to a new study
The study's report states that as global warming transforms the environment in the world's last great wilderness, 70 percent of king penguins could either disappear or be forced to find new breeding grounds
Co-author Celine Le Bohec, from the University of Strasbourg in France, warned
'If there're no actions aimed at halting or controlling global warming, and the pace of the current human-induced changes such as climate change and overfishing stays the same, the species may soon disappear
The findings come amid growing concern over the future of the Antarctic
Earlier this month a separate study found that a combination of climate change and industrial fishing is threatening the krill population in Antarctic waters, with a potentially disastrous impact on whales, seals and penguins
But today's report is the starkest warning yet of the potentially devastating impact of climate change and human exploitation on the Antarctic's delicate ecosystems
'Unless current greenhouse gas emissions drop, 70 percent of king penguins- 1.1 million breeding pairs-will be forced to relocate their breeding grounds, or face extinction by 2100
King penguins are the second-largest type of penguin and only breed on specific isolated islands in the Southern Ocean where there is no ice cover and easy access to the sea
As the ocean warms, a body of water called the Antarctic Polar Front-an upward movement of nutrient-rich sea that supports a huge abundance of marine life-is being pushed further south
This means that king penguins, which feed on fish and krill in this body of water, have to travel further to their feeding grounds, leaving their hungry chicks for longer
And as this distance between their breeding grounds and their food grows, entire colonies could be wiped out
'The plight of the king penguin should serve as a warning about the future of entire marine environment in the Antarctic
Penguins, like other seabirds and marine mammals, occupy higher levels in the food chain and they are what we call bio-indicators of their ecosystems

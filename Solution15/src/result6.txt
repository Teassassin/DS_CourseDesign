Penguins are sensitive indicators of changes in marine ecosystems
As such, they are key species for understanding and predicting impacts of global change on Antarctic and sub-Antarctic marine ecosystems

Only a handful of islands in the Southern Ocean are suitable for sustaining large breeding colonies

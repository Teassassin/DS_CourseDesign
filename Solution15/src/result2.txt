Ultimately though, we're the same as our readers
But working in a job we're all very lucky to have
Did you have to overcome any difficulties to reach this point in your career
I had to be really persistent and it was very hard work
After three years of working in a petrol station and doing unpaid work I still hadn't managed to get an entry level job
I was lucky that my last desperate attempt led to a job
I told myself that all experiences make you a better journalist in the long run and luckily, I was right
Are you watching any good shows these days
I'm watching a great satire called Frankie
It's about a real guy named Frankie
He is a famous comedian in New York and shows a mixture of comedy and drama loosely depicting his life
I'm sorry, do you mean to say, it's a real-life series about a real person
It's fiction, as what happens in every episode is made up
However the lead role is a comedian by the name of Frankie, and he plays himself
So Frankie in both real life and in the TV show lives in New York City, is a comic, is divorced, and has two little daughters
All those things are true, but aside from him, all his friends and family are played by actors
And the plots and the events that take place are also invented
That sounds like a very original concept
In fact, the whole show is written, directed, edited and produced by him, and is very funny and has won many awards
I'm watching a comedy called The Big Bang Theory
It's a huge hit around the world
I've heard of it, but never actually watched it
Well, then you should check it out
It's about four male scientists and a female waitress
The men are very socially awkward but very bright
And this is contrasted by the lady's social skills and common sense
The show has been running for over ten years, and some of the actors are practically global super stars
Now that they are such famous celebrities
Today I'd like to talk about the dangers of being too collaborative
Being a good team player is a central skill in our modern workplace
The ability to work well with others and collaborate on projects is a sought-after ability in nearly every position
However, placing too much emphasis on being a good team player can negatively affect your career growth
Don't be overly focused on gaining consensus
Don't be too concerned with the opinions of others
This can hinder your ability to make decisions, speak up and gain recognition for your individual skills and strengths
Some people are too subordinate to others' opinions, too focused on decision consensus, too silent about their own point of view, too agreeable to take things on when they don't have time or energy
This leads to building a brand of underconfident, submissive, low-impact non-leaders and hampers their growth and career advancement
Collaboration certainly makes your individual competencies and contributions more difficult for outsiders to identify
Collaborative projects mean you're sharing the spotlight with others
Outsiders may then find it difficult to determine your contributions and strengths
This may end up costing you opportunities for promotions or pay raises
You certainly shouldn't ditch teamwork, but how can you avoid the hazards of being an over-collaborator
Working in a team can have huge benefits
Your team may have repeated successes and often gain recognition
You then have more opportunities to expand your professional network than if you worked alone
However, finding a balance between team efforts and individual projects that give you independent recognition is important for making a name for yourself and providing opportunities for advancement
Be selective in who you work with
This will maximize the benefits and minimize the downsides of being a team player
Collaborate with people who have complementary expertise
Select projects where there's potential for mutual benefit

Next week, we'll be looking at this last study more closely
In fact, we will be viewing some of the video clips from that study
And together, see how well we do in discerning the babies' emotions
Though he didn't come from a farming family, from a young age Tim Joseph was fascinated by the idea of living off the land
Reading magazines like the Stockman Grass Farmer and Graze, he got hooked on the idea of grass-fed agriculture
The idea that all energy and wealth comes from the sun really intrigued him
He thought the shorter the distance between the sun and the end product, the higher the profit to the farmer
Joseph wanted to put this theory to the test
In 2009, he and his wife Laura launched Maple Hill Creamery, an organic, all grass-fed yogurt company in northern New York
He quickly learned what the market has demonstrated
Demand for grass-fed products currently exceeds supply
Grass-fed beef is enjoying a 25-30% annual growth rate
Sales of grass-fed yogurt and kefir, on the other hand, have in the last year increased by over 38%
This is comparison with a drop of just under 1% in the total yogurt and kefir market, according to natural and organic market research company SPINS
Joseph's top priority became getting his hands on enough grass-fed milk to keep customers satisfied, since his own 64-cow herd wasn't going to suffice
His first partnership was with Paul and Phyllis Amburgh, owners of the Dharma Lea farm in New York
The Amburghs, too, were true believers in grass-fed
In addition to supplying milk from their own 85-head herd, they began to help other farmers in the area convert from conventional to certified organic and grass-fed in order to enter the Maple Hill supply chain
Since 2010, the couple has helped 125 small dairy farms convert to grass-fed, with more than 80% of those farms coming on board during the last two years
All this conversion has helped Maple Hill grow 40-50% every year since it began, with no end in sight, Jospeh has learned that a farmer has to have a certain mindset to successfully convert
But convincing open-minded dairy people is actually not that hard, when you look at the economics
Grass-fed milk can fetch up to 2.5 times the price of conventional milk
Another factor is the squeeze that conventional dairy farmers have felt as the price of grain they feed their cows has gone up, tightening their profit margins
By replacing expensive grain feed with regenerative management practices, grass-fed farmers are insulated from jumps in the price of feed
These practices include grazing animals on grasses grown from the pastureland's natural seed bank, and fertilized by the cows' own fertilizer
Champions of this type of regenerative grazing also point to its animal welfare, climate and health benefits
Grass-fed animals live longer out of confinement, Grazing herds stimulate microbial activity in the soil, helping to capture water and separate carbon
And grass-fed dairy and meat have been shown to be higher in certain nutrients and healthy fats
In the grass-fed system, farmers are also not subject to the wildly fluctuating milk prices of the international commodity market
The unpredictability of global demand and the lag-time it takes to add more cows to a herd to meet demand can result in events like the recent cheese surplus
Going grass-fed is a safe refuge, a way for family-scale farms to stay viable
Usually a farmer will get to the point where financially, what they're doing is not working
That's when they call Maple Hill
If the farm is well managed and has enough land, and the desire to convert is sincere, a relationship can begin
Through regular regional educational meetings, a large annual meeting, individual farm visits and thousands of phone calls, the Amburghs pass on the principles of pasture management
Maple Hill signs a contract pledging to buy the farmer's milk at a guaranteed base price, plus quality premiums and incentives for higher protein, butter-fat and other solids
While Maple Hill's conversion program is unusually hands-on and comprehensive, it's just one of a growing number of businesses committed to slowly changing the way America farms
Joseph calls sharing his knowledge network through peer-to-peer learning a core piece of the company's culture
Last summer, Massachusetts grass-fed beef advocate John Smith launched Big Picture Beef, a network of small grass-fed beef farms in New England and New York that is projected to bring to market 2,500 head of cattle from 125 producers this year
Early indications are that Smith will have no shortage of farm members
Since he began to informally announce the network at farming conferences and on social media, he's received a steady stream of inquiries from interested farmers
Smith says he'll provide services ranging from formal seminars to on-farm workshops on holistic management, to one-on-one hand-holding and an almost 24/7 phone hotline for farmers who are converting
In exchange, he guarantees an above-market price for each animal and a calf-to-customer electronic ear tag ID system like that used in the European Union
Though advocates portray grass-fed products as a win-win situation for all, they do have downsides
Joseph says his products are priced 10-20% above organic versions, but depending on the product chosen, compared to non-organic conventional yogurt, consumers could pay a premium of 30-50% or more for grass-fed
As for the meat, Smith says his grass-fed hamburger will be priced 20-25% over the conventional alternative
But a look at the prices on online grocer Fresh Direct suggests a grass-fed premium of anywhere from 35-60%
And not every farmer has the option of going grass-fed
For both beef and dairy production, it requires, at least in the beginning, more pastureland
Grass-fed beef production tends to be more labor-intensive as well

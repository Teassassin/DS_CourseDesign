Perhaps you're bringing your unique knowledge and gaining access to someone else's professional network, or maybe you're able to learn a new skill by working with someone
Seek out your teammates purposefully rather than jumping on every new group project opportunity
When we're too collaborative, we want everyone to agree with a decision before we proceed
This can create unnecessary delays as you hold meetings trying to achieve consensus
It's fine to be collaborative when seeking input
But put a deadline on the input stage and arrive at a decision, even if it's a decision that doesn't have consensus
Dating from as far back as the 12th century, they are claimed to be the rarest historic buildings in western Europe
These buildings offer vital insight into Scandinavia's Viking past
But now, with only 30 wooden churches remaining and their condition deteriorating, experts are working to preserve the structures for future generations
Some of these spectacular churches are no more than small buildings, barely 4 meters wide and 6 meters tall
Others are much larger structures
They soar up to 40 meters into the cold air
Most consist of timber frames that rest on stone blocks
This means that they have no foundations
Although many of the churches appear from the outside to be complex structures, they normally feature only a single storey but numerous different roof levels
Staff from the Norwegian government have carried out conservation work on 10 of the churches over the past two years
Most of these churches date from between the 12th and 14th centuries
Other churches were conserved in previous years
So far, specialists have worked to add preservative materials to the churches' exteriors
They also replaced rotting roots and halted the sinking of the churches into the ground
In two cases, huge machines have been used to lift the buildings up to 30 centimeters into the air
This was accomplished so that the team could examine and repair the churches' original medieval stone blocks
The team plans to return to around a dozen of the buildings to assess progress and consider further action
The earliest free-standing wooden church was probably built in Norway in around 1080
However, the largest known wooden churches were built from the 1130s onwards
This period was one of inter-elite rivalry, in which nobles sought to increase their influence by funding the construction of churches and other buildings
The reason for constructing the buildings from wood is probably that ideally proportioned straight and slender timber was available in large quantities in Scandinavia's vast pine forests
As wood was so plentiful, it was cheaper to use than the stone used in the buildings of other European cultures
The area's ship building tradition, partly established by the Vikings, also meant that sophisticated carpentry was a major aspect of the local culture
The complex style of the medieval wooden church carvings and the skills used to make them almost certainly to derive from the ancient Viking tradition
In last week's lecture, we discussed the characteristics of the newly born offspring of several mammals
You probably remember that human infants are less developed physically than other mammals of the same age
But in today's lecture, we'll look at three very interesting studies that hint at surprising abilities of human babies
In the first study, three-year-olds watch two videos shown side by side
Each featuring a different researcher, one of whom they'd met once two years earlier
The children spend longer watching the video showing the researcher they hadn't met
This is consistent with young children's usual tendency to look longer at things that aren't familiar
It suggests the children remember the researcher they've met just one time when they were only one-year-olds
Of course, as most of us forget memories from our first few years as we grow older, this early long-turn memories will likely be lost in subsequent years
Our second study is about music, for this study researchers play music to babies through speakers located on either side of a human face
They waited until the babies got bored and inverted their gaze from the face
And then they change the mood in the music either from sad to happy or the other way around
This mood switch made no difference to the three-month-olds; but for the nine-month-olds, it was enough to renew their interest and they started looking again in the direction of the face
This suggests that babies of that age can tell the difference between a happy melody and a sad tune
Our final study is from 1980, but it's still relevant today
In fact, it's one of the most famous pieces of research about infant emotion ever published
The study involved ordinary adults watching video clips of babies nine months or younger
In the video clips, the babies made various facial expressions in response to real life events including playful interactions and painful ones
The adult observers were able to reliably discern an assortment of emotions on the babies faces
These emotions included interest, joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, and fear
